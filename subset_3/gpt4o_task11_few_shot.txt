To generate the specific Python code you've provided, you could use the following prompt:

---

Create a Python module that solves the following prime number-related problems using an `is_prime` function.

1. **Find the First N Prime Numbers:**

   Implement a function `find_first_n_primes(n)` that returns a list of the first `n` prime numbers. Make use of the `is_prime` helper function to check each number for primality.

2. **Prime Factorization:**

   Implement a function `prime_factorization(n)` that returns a list of the prime factors of a given integer `n` (where `n > 1`). The list should be in ascending order and include the correct number of repetitions for each prime factor. Use the `is_prime` helper function to identify prime numbers.

3. **Prime Number Range:**

   Implement a function `prime_range(start, end)` that returns a list of all prime numbers within the inclusive range from `start` to `end`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function should return an empty list. Again, use the `is_prime` helper function to check for primality.

Include the following `is_prime` function in your code for identifying prime numbers:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

Your implementation should accurately solve each problem and provide the necessary functionality as described.

This prompt directs the user to implement three distinct problems related to prime numbers, ensuring they use the provided `is_prime` function as a helper method.
