 The code you've provided appears to be incomplete and may not contain a complete Java method. However, based on the information available, there are two potential null dereference risks:

1. `line` is being dereferenced using the dot operator (`.`) before the `split()` method call. If `line` is null, this will cause a NullPointerException at runtime. To avoid this, it's best to check if `line` is null before calling the `split()` method.
2. The code assumes that the `split()` method will always return an array with at least one element. If the input string contains no commas, the `split()` method will return an empty array, which may not be handled correctly by subsequent code in the method. To avoid this, it's best to check if the result of the `split()` method call is not null or empty before proceeding further.

Here's an example of how you could modify the code to handle these risks:
```java
public static String[] parse_csv_line(String line) {
    if (line == null || line.isEmpty()) {
        return new String[0];
    }

    String[] parts = line.split(",");
    // additional checks and processing here...
}
```
