 The provided code is for a Flask web application that sets up a route for the endpoint '/greet/<username>' and defines a function 'greet' to handle the request. However, the implementation of the 'greet' function is incomplete as it only contains a comment "TODO : Return a JSON greeting" and an empty pass statement.

To implement the functionality, you can return a JSON response containing a greeting message for the specified user. Here's an example implementation:
```python
import json

@app . route (’/greet/<username>’)
def greet ( username ) :
    # Return a JSON greeting
    greeting = {'message': f"Hello, {username}! Welcome to the app."}
    return jsonify(greeting)
```
This implementation uses the 'jsonify' function from Flask to convert a Python dictionary into a JSON-formatted response. The dictionary contains a single key-value pair, where the value is a f-string that generates a personalized greeting for the user based on their username.
