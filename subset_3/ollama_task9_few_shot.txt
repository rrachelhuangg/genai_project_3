 The code provided is in Python and checks if a given number `n` is prime by iterating through the numbers from 2 to `int( n ** 0.5 ) + 1`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False` indicating that the number is not prime. Otherwise, it returns `True`, meaning that `n` is a prime number.

The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it immediately returns `False` because numbers less than 2 are not considered prime. Then, it iterates through the range of numbers from 2 to `int( n ** 0.5 ) + 1`, which is essentially the range of possible factors for `n`. It checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers (using the modulus operator `%`) and if so, it returns `False`. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `True`.

This function is efficient because it only needs to check up to the square root of `n`, since any factor greater than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root. This optimization reduces the number of iterations needed to determine if a number is prime or not.
