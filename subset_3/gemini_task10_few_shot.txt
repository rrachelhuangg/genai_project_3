The provided Python functions all validate strings using regular expressions.  They import the `re` module and define a function that takes a string as input.  Inside the function, `re.match()` attempts to match a defined regular expression pattern from the *beginning* of the input string.  The function returns `True` if the string matches the pattern and `False` otherwise, achieved by converting the result of `re.match()` to a boolean.  The regular expression pattern enforces specific validation rules for each type of string being validated: phone number, password and URL.
