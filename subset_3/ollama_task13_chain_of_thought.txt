 Here is a possible implementation of the `deleteNode` function in C:
```
void deleteNode(struct Node **head, int key) {
  if (*head == NULL) {
    return;
  }
  
  if ((*head)->data == key) {
    struct Node *temp = *head;
    *head = (*head)->next;
    free(temp);
    return;
  }
  
  struct Node *current = *head;
  while (current->next != NULL && current->next->data != key) {
    current = current->next;
  }
  
  if (current->next == NULL) {
    return;
  }
  
  struct Node *temp = current->next;
  current->next = current->next->next;
  free(temp);
}
```
This implementation uses a loop to traverse the list and find the node with the specified key. If the node is found, it is removed from the list using `free`. Note that this implementation assumes that the input list is not empty.
