To complete the constructor for the `Person` class with name, age, and an optional email, you'll want to initialize an instance of `Person` with these attributes. Here's the completed constructor:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, email=None):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.email = email
```

This constructor initializes three instance variables:
- `name` with the provided `name` parameter.
- `age` with the provided `age` parameter.
- `email` with the provided `email` parameter, defaulting to `None` if no email is supplied. 

The structure allows for flexibility, where `email` can be omitted during object instantiation if it's not immediately necessary.
