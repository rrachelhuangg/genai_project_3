 For the review app with users, books, and reviews, here's an example SQL schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(255),
    LastName VARCHAR(255),
    Email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    Password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Books (
    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ReleaseYear INT,
    Genre VARCHAR(255),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    UserID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)
);

CREATE TABLE Reviews (
    ReviewID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    UserID INT NOT NULL,
    BookID INT NOT NULL,
    Rating INT NOT NULL,
    Comment TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID),
    FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID)
);
```
This schema defines three tables: `Users`, `Books`, and `Reviews`. The `Users` table contains information about the users, such as their unique identifiers (`UserID`), first name, last name, email, and password. The `Books` table holds data about the books, including their titles, authors, release years, genres, prices, and associated user. Finally, the `Reviews` table captures reviews written by users about specific books, with fields for the review ID, the associated user and book, rating, and comment.
