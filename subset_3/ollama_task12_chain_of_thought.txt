 The bug in the provided Python code is that the loop condition `for i in range(1, n)` should include the value of `n`. Therefore, the corrected code should be:
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):  # Include n in the range
        result *= i
    return result
```
Now when the input is `0`, the loop will still run once with `i=0`, and the `result` will be updated to `1`. Therefore, the function will correctly return `1` as the factorial of `0`.
