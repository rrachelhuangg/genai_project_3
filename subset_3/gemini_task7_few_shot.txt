The provided code is in Python, not Java.  Therefore, the concept of a "Java null dereference risk" is not applicable.  Python uses `None` which is handled differently than `null` in Java.

That said, let's analyze the Python code for potential issues related to using `None`:

*   **Accessing `email` when it's `None`:**  The code creates instances where `email` is explicitly set to `None` (e.g., `employee2`, `student2`, optional argument).  The `print` statements then access `employee.email` or `student.email`.  In Python, this is perfectly valid.  Printing `None` will just output "None".  There's no error. The same is true for potentially null `age` in Contact.

*   **Methods that operate on `email`:**  If you later added methods to these classes that *used* the `email` attribute (e.g., sending an email), *that's* where you'd need to check for `email is not None` before proceeding.  The given code does not have any such methods.

**In summary:** The provided Python code is safe with respect to `None` handling. It gracefully handles cases where `email` and `age` are `None` without throwing errors. The `print` statements will just output "None" for these values. However, be cautious if adding methods that *operate* on these potentially `None` attributes.
