 Here's the corrected `factorial` function that correctly calculates the factorial of a number *n* using an iterative approach:
```python
def factorial(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  result = 1
  for i in range (1, n+1):
    result *= i
  return result
```
This function calculates the factorial of `n` using a loop that iterates from `1` up to and including `n`, multiplying the result by each number in the loop. The base case is when `n` is equal to `0`, in which case the factorial is defined as `1`.
