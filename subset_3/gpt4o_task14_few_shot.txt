To complete the recursive Python function for the Fibonacci sequence, let's use the same principles of recursion: base cases, recursive step, and well-defined problem statement.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

- Base cases: 
  - \( F(0) = 0 \)
  - \( F(1) = 1 \)

- Recursive step:
  - For \( n \geq 2 \), \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \)

With this definition in mind, here's how you can implement the Fibonacci function recursively in Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Calculates the nth Fibonacci number recursively.
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0  # Base case: F(0) = 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1  # Base case: F(1) = 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)  # Recursive step

# Example Usage:
print(fibonacci(0))  # Output: 0
print(fibonacci(1))  # Output: 1
print(fibonacci(2))  # Output: 1
print(fibonacci(3))  # Output: 2
print(fibonacci(4))  # Output: 3
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
print(fibonacci(6))  # Output: 8
```

### Explanation

1. **Base Cases:** 
   - For \( n = 0 \), we return 0.
   - For \( n = 1 \), we return 1.

2. **Recursive Step:**
   - For larger \( n \), the function calls itself with \( n - 1 \) and \( n - 2 \) and adds the results, following the Fibonacci sequence definition.

This recursive approach exemplifies how recursion can elegantly express the Fibonacci sequence. However, note that this implementation is not efficient for large `n` due to repeated recalculation of the same values, leading to an exponential time complexity. For larger inputs, more efficient approaches such as using iteration or dynamic programming are recommended.
