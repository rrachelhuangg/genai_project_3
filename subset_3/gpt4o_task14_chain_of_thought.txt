To complete the recursive Fibonacci function, we need to address both the base cases and the recursive case. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

- \( F(0) = 0 \)
- \( F(1) = 1 \)
- For \( n \geq 2 \), \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \)

We will implement this in the function step by step:

1. **Base Cases**: For the Fibonacci sequence, we handle the cases where \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \) directly by returning 0 and 1 respectively.
2. **Recursive Case**: For \( n \geq 2 \), the function should return the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers, \( F(n-1) + F(n-2) \).

Let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    # Base case: if n is 0, return 0
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    # Base case: if n is 1, return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive case: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Usage example (not part of the function, just to test):
# print(fibonacci(5))  # Output should be 5
```

Explanation:
- For \( n = 0 \), the function directly returns 0.
- For \( n = 1 \), the function directly returns 1.
- For \( n \geq 2 \), the function calls itself recursively to compute the sum of the Fibonacci numbers at \( n-1 \) and \( n-2 \).

This recursive approach is straightforward but not efficient for large \( n \) due to its exponential time complexity. In practice, you would typically use an iterative approach or memoization to optimize this calculation for larger inputs.
