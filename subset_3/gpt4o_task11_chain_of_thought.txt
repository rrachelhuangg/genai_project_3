To generate the given Python code step-by-step, you can use the following prompt:

**Prompt:**

Let's write a Python function to check if a number is prime.

Step 1: Define the function.

```python
# This function checks if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
```

Step 2: Handle base cases. Remember that numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.

```python
    if n <= 1:
        return False
```

Step 3: Check for factors from 2 up to the square root of n. If a factor is found, the number is not prime.

```python
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
```

Step 4: If no factors are found, return True because the number is prime.

```python
    return True
```

Combine all steps to complete the function definition.
