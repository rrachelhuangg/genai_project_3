Please complete the Python function based on the intent that you previous identified: def calculate_average ( scores ) :
    total = 0
    # TODO : Complete to return average
    pass
Your previous rseponse:
"The intent of the provided Python function `calculate_average` is to calculate the average of a list of numerical scores. The function currently initializes a variable `total` to 0, and there is a TODO comment indicating that the function needs to be completed to return the average of the scores.

Here is a possible implementation of the function to achieve the intended purpose:

```python
def calculate_average(scores):
    if not scores:  # Check if the list is empty
        return 0  # Return 0 if there are no scores to avoid division by zero

    total = sum(scores)  # Calculate the sum of all scores
    average = total / len(scores)  # Calculate the average
    return average  # Return the calculated average
```

This implementation ensures that the function calculates the average of the scores provided in the `scores` list. It also handles the case where the list is empty by returning 0, although this behavior can be adjusted based on specific requirements."
