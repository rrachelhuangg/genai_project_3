 The code you've provided is a Python script, not C++. However, I can still classify the bug in this script for you.

The bug in this code is that the `clean_line` function calls the `clean` variable, but it's never assigned a value. This means that when `clean_line` is called, it will raise an error because there is no value to return. To fix this bug, you need to assign a value to the `clean` variable before using it in the `count_words` function.
