```python
def process(x):
    """
    This function validates an input, calculates its square, and returns the result.
    """
    if x < 0:
        return -1
    return x * x

# Example usage to demonstrate (not part of the fix, but helpful)
print(process(-5))  # Output: -1
print(process(0))   # Output: 0
print(process(5))   # Output: 25
```

**Explanation of the problem and the fix:**

The original code snippet was not valid Python, and contained C++ style syntax. The 'int' type annotations are invalid in Python.

The corrected code is valid Python code.  There was no off-by-one error in the *logic* of the original prompt's description. It just did not have valid syntax and would not compile.  The function already performed the described calculation without off-by-one error.

I've also added a docstring to explain what the function does, which is good practice. And, I added example usage with `print()` statements to show how the function works and verify the output.
