```python
def sum_range(start, end):
    """
    Calculates the sum of numbers within a specified range (inclusive).

    Args:
        start: The starting number of the range (inclusive).
        end: The ending number of the range (inclusive).

    Returns:
        The sum of all numbers within the range [start, end].
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):  # Corrected line: Include 'end' in the range
        total += i
    return total
```

**Reasoning for the fix:**

The original code used `range(start, end)`. The `range()` function in Python generates a sequence of numbers from `start` (inclusive) up to, but *not including*, `end`. This means the number `end` itself was never added to the `total`.

To include `end` in the sum, we need to change the `range()` function call to `range(start, end + 1)`. This will generate a sequence of numbers from `start` up to and including `end`, ensuring that all numbers within the desired range are summed correctly.
