 This Java method takes a list of words as input and returns a map that contains the frequency of each word in the list. It uses a HashMap to store the map, where the keys are the unique words in the list, and the values are the number of occurrences of each word. The method iterates through the list of words and updates the count for each word in the HashMap. If a word is not already present in the map, it adds a new entry with a value of 1. If the word is already present, it increments the count by 1. The method returns the final map containing the frequency of each word.
