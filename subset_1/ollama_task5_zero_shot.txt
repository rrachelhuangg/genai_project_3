 To create the endpoint `/greet/{username}` that returns a JSON greeting, you can use the following code:
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/greet/<username>')
def greet(username):
    # Create the greeting message with the user's name
    greeting = f"Hello {username}, nice to meet you!"
    
    # Return a JSON response with the greeting message
    return jsonify({'greeting': greeting})
```
In this code, we import the `Flask` and `jsonify` modules from Flask. We create an instance of the `Flask` class with the name of the current module as its argument (`__name__`). Then we define a route for the endpoint `/greet/{username}` using the `@app.route` decorator.

Inside the `greet` function, we create a greeting message using an f-string that includes the user's name passed as an argument (`username`). Finally, we use the `jsonify` function to convert the greeting message into a JSON object with a single key called "greeting", and return it as a response.
