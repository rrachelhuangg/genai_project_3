 This is a Java method that takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer indicating whether the number is even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder) or odd (i.e., not divisible by 2 with no remainder). The method uses the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate the remainder of `n` divided by 2, and returns 1 if the remainder is 0, indicating that `n` is even, and 0 otherwise, indicating that `n` is odd. This is a simple implementation of the "modulo" operation in Java.
