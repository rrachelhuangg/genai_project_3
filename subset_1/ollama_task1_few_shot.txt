 The `countWordFrequency` method is used to count the frequency of each word in a given list of words. It uses a `HashMap` to store the frequency of each word as key-value pairs, where the key is the word itself and the value is the frequency of that word in the list. The method iterates over each word in the list and adds one to its corresponding value in the frequency map or initializes it with 1 if the word is not present in the map. Finally, the method returns the filled frequency map.
