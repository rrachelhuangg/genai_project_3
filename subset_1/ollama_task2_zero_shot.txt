 The given code is written in C, not Python. In C, the function signature should be `int process(int x)` instead of `int process(int x )`. Additionally, there's an off-by-one error in the conditional statement: the correct condition to check if the input is negative or zero is `if (x <= 0)`, since `x < 0` will only match negative numbers and not zero. Here's the corrected code in C:
```c
int process(int x) {
    if (x <= 0) return -1;
    return x * x ;
}
```
In Python, the corrected function would look like this:
```python
def process(x):
    if x <= 0:
        return -1
    return x ** 2
```
