 The off-by-one error in this Python function occurs because the loop starts from `start` and ends at `end`, but the range function includes the `end` value itself. This means that if `start = 1` and `end = 4`, for example, the loop will include the number `4`, but it will not include the number `5`.

To fix this error, we can add `1` to both the start and end values of the range function, which will include all numbers up to, but not including, the end value:
```
def sum_range ( start , end ) :
    total = 0
    for i in range ( start + 1 , end ) :
        total += i
    return total
```
