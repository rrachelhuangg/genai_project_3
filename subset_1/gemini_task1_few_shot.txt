The Java method `countWordFrequency` takes a list of strings (`words`) as input and returns a map (`freqMap`) that stores the frequency of each word in the list.

Specifically, the method iterates through the input list of words. For each word, it updates the `freqMap`. The `getOrDefault` method is used to check if the word already exists as a key in the map.  If it does, its corresponding value (frequency) is incremented by 1. If it doesn't, the word is added to the map with a frequency of 1.  Finally, the populated `freqMap` is returned, containing each unique word from the input list and its corresponding frequency.
