```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/greet/<username>')
def greet(username):
    """
    Greets the user with a personalized message.

    Args:
        username (str): The name of the user to greet.

    Returns:
        JSON: A JSON object containing the greeting message.
    """
    greeting = f"Hello, {username}!"
    return jsonify({'greeting': greeting})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True) # Enable debug mode for development
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`from flask import Flask, jsonify`**:  Crucially imports `jsonify` to convert the Python dictionary into a JSON response.  Without this, you'd likely get a `TypeError` from Flask.

* **`app = Flask(__name__)`**: Standard Flask application initialization.

* **`@app.route('/greet/<username>')`**:  Correctly defines the route with the `<username>` variable part.  This is how Flask captures the username from the URL.

* **`def greet(username):`**: Defines the function to handle the route. The `username` parameter automatically receives the value from the URL.

* **`greeting = f"Hello, {username}!"`**: Uses an f-string (formatted string literal) for concise string formatting.

* **`return jsonify({'greeting': greeting})`**:  **This is the most important part.**  `jsonify` takes a dictionary as input and converts it to a JSON response with the correct `Content-Type` header ( `application/json` ). This tells the browser or client that the response is JSON data.

* **`if __name__ == '__main__':`**:  This ensures the Flask development server only starts when you run the script directly (not when it's imported as a module).

* **`app.run(debug=True)`**:  Starts the Flask development server. `debug=True` enables the debugger, which is very helpful during development.  **Do not use `debug=True` in production!**

**How to Run:**

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
2.  **Install Flask:** If you don't have it, install Flask:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```
3.  **Run the app:** Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

This will start the Flask development server. You'll see output like:

```
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Click Ctrl+C to quit
```

**How to Test:**

Open your web browser (or use `curl` or `Postman`) and go to the following URL:

*   `http://127.0.0.1:5000/greet/Alice`

You should see the following JSON response in your browser:

```json
{
  "greeting": "Hello, Alice!"
}
```

Test with other usernames to verify it's working correctly.

**Example using `curl`:**

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/greet/Bob
```

Output:

```json
{
  "greeting": "Hello, Bob!"
}
```
