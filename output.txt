PROBLEM 18 
Certainly! Here is the completed Python function `calculate_average` based on the intent to calculate the average of a list of numerical scores:

```python
def calculate_average(scores):
    if not scores:  # Check if the list is empty
        return 0  # Return 0 if there are no scores to avoid division by zero

    total = sum(scores)  # Calculate the sum of all scores
    average = total / len(scores)  # Calculate the average
    return average  # Return the calculated average
```

This function does the following:
1. Checks if the `scores` list is empty. If it is, the function returns 0 to avoid division by zero.
2. Computes the sum of all the scores using the `sum` function.
3. Calculates the average by dividing the total sum by the number of scores (the length of the `scores` list).
4. Returns the calculated average.

You can test the function with different input lists to ensure it works correctly:

```python
# Example usage:
scores = [85, 90, 92, 88, 95]
average = calculate_average(scores)
print(f"The average score is: {average}")

# Test with an empty list:
empty_scores = []
empty_average = calculate_average(empty_scores)
print(f"The average score for an empty list is: {empty_average}")
```

This will output:
```
The average score is: 90.0
The average score for an empty list is: 0
```
