PROBLEM 22 
Certainly! Below is the completed script with the necessary changes to clean each line, remove punctuation, and count word frequencies correctly.

```python
# file_processor.py - Complete script for processing text files

import string

def load_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return f.readlines()

def clean_line(line):
    # Remove punctuation and make lowercase
    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    return line.translate(translator).lower()

def count_words(lines):
    word_counts = {}
    for line in lines:
        clean = clean_line(line)
        for word in clean.split():
            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
    return word_counts

def main():
    filepath = 'input.txt'
    lines = load_file(filepath)
    counts = count_words(lines)
    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()):
        print(f"{word}: {count}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing the `string` module**: This is used to get a list of punctuation characters.
2. **`load_file` function**: Reads the file and returns a list of lines.
3. **`clean_line` function**:
   - Uses `str.maketrans` to create a translation table that maps each punctuation character to `None`.
   - Uses `str.translate` to remove punctuation from the line.
   - Converts the line to lowercase using `str.lower`.
4. **`count_words` function**:
   - Initializes an empty dictionary `word_counts` to store word frequencies.
   - Iterates over each line, cleans it, and splits it into words.
   - Updates the word counts in the dictionary.
5. **`main` function**:
   - Specifies the file path.
   - Loads the file content.
   - Counts the word frequencies.
   - Prints the word frequencies in sorted order.

This script will read a text file named `input.txt`, clean each line by removing punctuation and converting it to lowercase, count the frequency of each word, and print the word frequencies in alphabetical order.Sure, let's complete the script step by step.

1. **Remove punctuation and make lowercase in `clean_line` function.**
2. **Fix the indentation and iteration in the `count_words` function.**

Here's the complete script:

```python
# file_processor.py - Complete script for processing text files

import string

def load_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return f.readlines()

def clean_line(line):
    # Remove punctuation and make lowercase
    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    return line.translate(translator).lower()

def count_words(lines):
    word_counts = {}
    for line in lines:
        clean = clean_line(line)
        for word in clean.split():
            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
    return word_counts

def main():
    filepath = 'input.txt'
    lines = load_file(filepath)
    counts = count_words(lines)
    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()):
        print(f"{word}: {count}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **`load_file` Function**:
   - Opens the file in read mode and returns all lines as a list of strings.

2. **`clean_line` Function**:
   - Uses `str.maketrans` to create a translation table that maps each punctuation character to `None`.
   - Applies the translation table to the line using `translate`, which removes all punctuation.
   - Converts the line to lowercase using `lower`.

3. **`count_words` Function**:
   - Initializes an empty dictionary `word_counts`.
   - Iterates over each line, cleans it using `clean_line`, and splits the cleaned line into words.
   - For each word, updates the word count in the dictionary.

4. **`main` Function**:
   - Sets the file path to `input.txt`.
   - Loads the file lines using `load_file`.
   - Counts the word frequencies using `count_words`.
   - Prints each word and its count in a sorted manner.

### Usage:
- Ensure you have an `input.txt` file in the same directory as the script.
- Run the script, and it will print the word frequencies from the `input.txt` file.

This script should now correctly clean each line, remove punctuation, and count word frequencies.Certainly! I'll complete the script by implementing the `clean_line` function to remove punctuation and make each line lowercase. Here's the completed script:

```python
# file_processor.py - Script for processing text files

import string

def load_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return f.readlines()

def clean_line(line):
    # Remove punctuation and make lowercase
    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    cleaned_line = line.translate(translator).lower()
    return cleaned_line

def count_words(lines):
    word_counts = {}
    for line in lines:
        clean = clean_line(line)
        for word in clean.split():
            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
    return word_counts

def main():
    filepath = 'input.txt'
    lines = load_file(filepath)
    counts = count_words(lines)
    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()):
        print(f"{word}: {count}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **`load_file(filepath)`**: This function reads all lines from the specified file and returns them as a list.
2. **`clean_line(line)`**: This function removes punctuation from the line using `str.translate` and converts the line to lowercase.
3. **`count_words(lines)`**: This function processes each line, cleans it, splits it into words, and counts the frequency of each word.
4. **`main()`**: This function orchestrates the process by loading the file, counting the words, and printing the sorted word counts.

### How to Run:
1. Make sure you have an `input.txt` file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```sh
   python file_processor.py
   ```

This will read the `input.txt` file, clean each line, count the word frequencies, and print them in sorted order.Sure! Let's complete the script by implementing the `clean_line` function to remove punctuation and convert the text to lowercase. We'll also ensure that the `count_words` function processes each line correctly.

Here's the completed script:

```python
# file_processor.py - Script for processing text files

import string

def load_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return f.readlines()

def clean_line(line):
    # Remove punctuation and make lowercase
    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    return line.translate(translator).lower()

def count_words(lines):
    word_counts = {}
    for line in lines:
        clean = clean_line(line)
        for word in clean.split():
            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
    return word_counts

def main():
    filepath = 'input.txt'
    lines = load_file(filepath)
    counts = count_words(lines)
    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()):
        print(f"{word}: {count}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Importing `string` Module**: This module provides a string of all punctuation characters, which will be used to remove punctuation from the text.

2. **`load_file` Function**: This function reads all lines from the specified file and returns them as a list.

3. **`clean_line` Function**:
    - **Removing Punctuation**: We create a translation table using `str.maketrans` that maps each punctuation character to `None`. This table is then used with the `translate` method to remove all punctuation from the line.
    - **Lowercase Conversion**: The `lower` method converts the entire line to lowercase.

4. **`count_words` Function**:
    - **Processing Each Line**: Each line is cleaned using the `clean_line` function.
    - **Splitting into Words**: The cleaned line is split into individual words.
    - **Counting Words**: Each word is counted using a dictionary. If the word is already in the dictionary, its count is incremented; otherwise, it is added with a count of 1.

5. **`main` Function**: This function reads the file, counts the word frequencies, and prints the sorted results.

6. **Entry Point**: The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block ensures that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.

This script will read `input.txt`, clean each line, count the word frequencies, and print the results sorted alphabetically.Certainly! Let's complete the script by implementing the `clean_line` function to remove punctuation and convert the text to lowercase. Additionally, I will correct some minor issues in the provided script.

Here is the complete script:

```python
# file_processor.py - Script for processing text files

import string

def load_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return f.readlines()

def clean_line(line):
    # Remove punctuation and make lowercase
    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    return line.translate(translator).lower()

def count_words(lines):
    word_counts = {}
    for line in lines:
        clean = clean_line(line)
        for word in clean.split():
            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
    return word_counts

def main():
    filepath = 'input.txt'
    lines = load_file(filepath)
    counts = count_words(lines)
    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()):
        print(f"{word}: {count}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
