The provided Python function `reverse_words` takes a single argument, `sentence`, which is expected to be a string. The function splits the sentence into a list of words using the default space delimiter with the `split()` method. It then reverses the order of the list using the slice notation `[::-1]`. Finally, it joins the reversed list of words back into a single string with spaces in between each word using `' '.join()`, and returns this new string. Essentially, this function returns the input sentence with the order of the words reversed.
