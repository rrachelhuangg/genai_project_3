Yes, there is a potential null dereference risk in the `getLength` method. If the parameter `s` is null when the method is called, invoking `s.length()` will result in a `NullPointerException`. To mitigate this risk, you can add a null check before attempting to access the `length` method. Here's one way to handle it:

```java
public int getLength(String s) {
    if (s == null) {
        // Handle the null case, possibly by returning a default value like 0
        return 0;
    }
    return s.length();
}
```

By adding this check, you ensure that `s.length()` is only called when `s` is not null. If `s` is null, you can choose to return a default value, throw an exception, or handle it in another way depending on your application's requirements.
