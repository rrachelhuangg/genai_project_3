The Python function `reverse_words(sentence)` takes a string `sentence` as input, splits it into a list of words using spaces as delimiters, reverses the order of words in the list, and then joins the reversed list of words back into a single string with spaces in between.  Essentially, it reverses the order of words in a sentence.
