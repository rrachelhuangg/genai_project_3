The Python function `reverse_words(sentence)` takes a string `sentence` as input and returns a new string with the words in the input sentence reversed. It achieves this by:

1.  `sentence.split()`: Splitting the input sentence into a list of individual words, using whitespace as the delimiter.
2.  `[::-1]`: Reversing the order of the words in the list.
3.  `' '.join(...)`: Joining the reversed list of words back into a single string, with spaces separating each word.
