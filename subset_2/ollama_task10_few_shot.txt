The Python function `reverse_words(sentence)` takes a string `sentence` as input and returns a new string with the order of words reversed. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input:** A string `sentence` containing words separated by spaces.

2. **Process:**
   - The `split()` method is used on the input `sentence`, which breaks the sentence into a list of words based on whitespace.
   - The resulting list of words is then reversed using the slice notation `[:: -1]`, which creates a new list of words in reverse order.
   - The reversed list of words is combined back into a single string using `' '.join(...)`, which concatenates the words with a single space between each.

3. **Output:** A new string with the words in reverse order.

Example Usage:
```python
print(reverse_words("Hello world"))  # Outputs: "world Hello"
```

Note: The function assumes words are separated by spaces and doesn't preserve multiple spaces between words or at the ends of the sentence.
