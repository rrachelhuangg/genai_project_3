All the provided solutions are designed to mitigate null dereference risks. They all proactively check for `null` values on the input strings before attempting to access their `length` method. Specifically:

*   **Problem 1:** Checks if `s` is `null` and returns `defaultValue` if it is.  Avoids calling `s.length()` when `s` is `null`.
*   **Problem 2:** Uses the ternary operator to assign a length of 0 if either `s1` or `s2` are `null`, preventing `NullPointerException` when `.length()` is called.
*   **Problem 3:** Checks if `s1` and `s2` are `null` and substitutes them with either "0:" or "" respectively.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippets, there are no immediately apparent null dereference risks because they all correctly handle null input. The explanations also highlight null safety as a key aspect of the provided solutions.
