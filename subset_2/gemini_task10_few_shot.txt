The `reverse_words(sentence)` function takes a string `sentence` as input, splits it into a list of words using spaces as delimiters, reverses the order of the words in the list using slicing `[::-1]`, and then joins the reversed list of words back into a string with spaces in between. The function returns the reversed sentence as a single string.
