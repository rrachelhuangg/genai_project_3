To improve the `parse_csv_line` function so that it can handle various CSV complexities such as quoted fields and escaped double quotes, we need to refine the logic from a simple `split` operation to something that accounts for these nuances. While the example problems use regular expressions, Python's `csv` module provides a cleaner and more reliable way to parse CSV lines. 

Below, I'll illustrate how to handle the scenarios you've described using both a refined regular expression approach and the recommended `csv` module method.

### Using Regular Expressions:

Let's enhance the regular expression-based solution to handle quoted fields, escaped double quotes within those fields, and ignore leading/trailing spaces.

```python
import re

def parse_csv_line(line):
    """Parses a CSV line, handling quoted fields with escaped double quotes and trimming whitespace."""
    pattern = r'\s*"((?:[^"]|(?:""))*)"\s*|\s*([^,]+)\s*'
    # Using findall to capture either quoted or unquoted fields
    parts = re.findall(pattern, line)
    result = []
    for match in parts:
        quoted_field = match[0]
        unquoted_field = match[1]
        if quoted_field:
            # Handle escaped double quotes by replacing them with a single double quote
            result.append(quoted_field.replace('""', '"'))
        else:
            result.append(unquoted_field.strip())
    return result

# Example Usage
print(parse_csv_line(' name , " city , state " ,occupation  ,  "zip"'))
```
This solution handles your specified cases, including stripping whitespace and handling escaped quotes. However, for better error handling and performance, consider using Python's `csv` module.

### Using Python's csv Module:

Python's `csv` module handles complex CSV parsing, including quotes and delimiter handling, and is optimized for such tasks.

```python
import csv
from io import StringIO

def parse_csv_line(line):
    """Parses a CSV line using Python's csv.reader to handle quoted fields and trimming spaces."""
    # Create a StringIO object to simulate a file object for the csv.reader
    input_stream = StringIO(line)
    reader = csv.reader(input_stream, skipinitialspace=True)
    # Get the first (and only) row parsed, then strip whitespace from each element
    return [entry.strip() for entry in next(reader)]

# Example Usage
print(parse_csv_line(' name , " city , state " ,occupation  ,  "zip"'))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Regular Expressions**:
   - The pattern matches either a quoted field (handling `""` as an escaped `"`) or an unquoted field, and uses `strip()` to remove extra spaces around fields.

2. **CSV Module**:
   - The `csv.reader` automatically handles commas within quoted fields and escaped quotes.
   - `skipinitialspace=True` makes it ignore white spaces following delimiters.
   - The `StringIO` class is utilized to provide a file-like object to `csv.reader`.

### Key Takeaways:

- **csv module**: It is highly recommended for parsing CSV data in production due to its robustness and simplicity for handling various CSV formats.
- **Robustness**: Both methods ensure leading/trailing spaces are stripped and handle basic escaped quotes.
- **Complexity**: Using the `csv` module significantly simplifies the code while ensuring comprehensiveness and correctness, hence is preferred for reliability.
