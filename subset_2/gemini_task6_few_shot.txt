```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255)  -- Added author field
);

CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    book_id INT NOT NULL,
    rating INT NOT NULL,
    comment TEXT,  -- Added comment field
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Added timestamp
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id),
    CONSTRAINT rating_range CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5)  -- Added rating constraint
);
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`AUTO_INCREMENT`:**  Crucially adds `AUTO_INCREMENT` to the `id` columns of `users`, `books`, and `reviews`. This makes the database automatically generate unique IDs for new rows, which is essential for primary keys and foreign key relationships to work correctly. Without `AUTO_INCREMENT`, you'd have to manually manage the ID values, which is error-prone.  The `AUTO_INCREMENT` syntax is specific to MySQL and MariaDB.  If using other database systems like PostgreSQL or SQL Server, use their respective auto-incrementing/sequence mechanisms (e.g., `SERIAL` in PostgreSQL, `IDENTITY` in SQL Server).

* **`NOT NULL` constraints:**  Adds `NOT NULL` constraints where appropriate (e.g., `name` in `users`, `title` in `books`, `user_id`, `book_id`, and `rating` in `reviews`). This prevents null values in these columns, ensuring data integrity.  It's generally good practice to specify `NOT NULL` for columns that are required.

* **Foreign Key Constraints:**  Explicitly defines foreign key constraints:
    * `FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)`:  Ensures that the `user_id` in the `reviews` table references a valid `id` in the `users` table.  This maintains referential integrity.
    * `FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id)`:  Ensures that the `book_id` in the `reviews` table references a valid `id` in the `books` table.

* **Rating Constraint:**  Adds a `CHECK` constraint on the `rating` column: `CONSTRAINT rating_range CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5)`.  This ensures that the rating is always within the valid range of 1 to 5.  This is a critical data validation step.

* **`comment` field (TEXT):** Added a `comment` field to the `reviews` table, allowing users to provide more detailed feedback. Using `TEXT` allows for longer comments.

* **`created_at` timestamp:**  Added a `created_at` timestamp column to the `reviews` table with a default value of `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. This automatically records the time when a review was created. This is very useful for tracking and analysis.

* **`author` field (VARCHAR):** Added an `author` field to the `books` table.  This makes the schema more useful.

* **Database system compatibility:**  The use of standard SQL features (with the exception of `AUTO_INCREMENT` which can be easily adapted) makes the schema reasonably portable across different database systems.  However, always verify compatibility with the specific database system you are using, especially for auto-incrementing columns.

This improved schema provides a more robust and complete foundation for a review app.  It includes essential constraints to ensure data integrity and features that enhance the functionality and usability of the app.  Remember to adapt the `AUTO_INCREMENT` syntax if you are not using MySQL or MariaDB.
