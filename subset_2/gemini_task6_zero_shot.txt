```sql
-- Table: users
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Table: books
CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Table: reviews
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    book_id INT NOT NULL,
    rating INT NOT NULL,
    review_text TEXT, -- Optional: Add a column for the review text
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Optional: Add timestamp for review creation

    -- Foreign key constraints
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id),

    -- Rating should be between 1 and 5 (inclusive)
    CONSTRAINT chk_rating CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
);


-- Example data insertion
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice');
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Bob');

INSERT INTO books (title) VALUES ('The Lord of the Rings');
INSERT INTO books (title) VALUES ('Pride and Prejudice');

INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, book_id, rating, review_text) VALUES (1, 1, 5, 'A fantastic read!');
INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, book_id, rating, review_text) VALUES (2, 1, 4, 'Enjoyable but a bit long.');
INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, book_id, rating, review_text) VALUES (1, 2, 3, 'Decent, not my cup of tea.');
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`AUTO_INCREMENT` for IDs:**  Uses `AUTO_INCREMENT` for `id` columns in `users`, `books`, and `reviews`.  This is *crucial* for database-managed unique IDs.  It automatically generates a new, unique ID for each new row.
* **`NOT NULL` Constraints:**  Added `NOT NULL` constraints to columns like `name` in `users`, `title` in `books`, and `user_id`, `book_id`, and `rating` in `reviews`. This ensures that these essential fields always have values.  It prevents incomplete or malformed data.
* **`FOREIGN KEY` Constraints:**  Defines `FOREIGN KEY` constraints for `user_id` and `book_id` in the `reviews` table. These constraints enforce referential integrity:
    * `FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)`:  Ensures that the `user_id` in the `reviews` table exists in the `id` column of the `users` table.  You can't have a review from a user that doesn't exist.
    * `FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id)`:  Ensures that the `book_id` in the `reviews` table exists in the `id` column of the `books` table. You can't have a review for a book that doesn't exist.
* **`CHECK` Constraint:**  Uses a `CHECK` constraint `CONSTRAINT chk_rating CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5)` to ensure that the `rating` is always within the valid range of 1 to 5. This is essential for data quality.
* **`TEXT` data type for `review_text`:**  Uses the `TEXT` data type for the `review_text` column in the `reviews` table.  `TEXT` is suitable for storing longer text reviews.  If you had very short reviews, `VARCHAR` might suffice, but `TEXT` is generally preferred.
* **`TIMESTAMP` for `created_at`:** Includes a `created_at` column in the `reviews` table, using the `TIMESTAMP` data type with `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. This automatically records the date and time when a review is created.  This is extremely useful for ordering reviews, analyzing trends, and debugging.
* **Clearer Column Names:** Uses `user_id` and `book_id` for the foreign key columns in the `reviews` table, which is more descriptive.
* **Example Data:** Includes example `INSERT` statements to populate the tables with some initial data. This makes it easier to test the schema.
* **`PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT`:** This sets up the `id` column in each table to be automatically incremented whenever a new row is inserted.  This is the standard and correct way to handle primary keys in most SQL databases.

This revised schema is much more robust, enforces data integrity, and includes features that are essential for a real-world review app.  It also includes a crucial `CHECK` constraint to ensure valid ratings.  The `created_at` timestamp column is also extremely useful.
