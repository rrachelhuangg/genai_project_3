```python
import re

def parse_csv_line(line):
    """Parses a CSV line, handling quoted fields with escaped double quotes and whitespace."""
    parts = re.findall(r'(?:(?=([^"]*"[^"]*"))|(?:^|,))\s*"([^"]*)"\s*|\s*([^,]+)\s*', line)
    result = []
    for match in parts:
        if match[1] or match[2]:
            result.append((match[1] or match[2]).replace('""', '"'))
        else:
            result.append(match[3])
    return [item.strip() for item in result if item]
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

The provided code directly addresses Problem 3, which incorporates the complexities of Problems 1 and 2.  Here's a breakdown of the changes and why they're important:

1. **Comprehensive Regular Expression:**

   The core of the solution is the regular expression:

   ```regex
   (?:(?=([^"]*"[^"]*"))|(?:^|,))\s*"([^"]*)"\s*|\s*([^,]+)\s*
   ```

   Let's break it down:

   *   `(?:(?=([^"]*"[^"]*"))|(?:^|,))`: This non-capturing group using lookahead aims to only consider capturing group patterns if there are an even number of quotes in the string, or if it is the beginning of the line or follows a comma.  This ensures that the groups will only capture valid csv entries.
   *   `\s*"`: Matches optional whitespace followed by a double quote (start of a quoted field).  The `\s*` handles leading spaces around the quotes.
   *   `([^"]*)`:  Captures the contents of the quoted field (any character except a double quote).  This is the core data.
   *   `"\s*`: Matches a double quote followed by optional whitespace (end of a quoted field). The `\s*` handles trailing spaces around the quotes.
   *   `\s*([^,]+)\s*`:  This part matches an unquoted field.
        * `\s*`: Matches optional leading whitespace.
        * `([^,]+)`: Captures one or more characters that are not commas (the unquoted field content).
        * `\s*`: Matches optional trailing whitespace.
   *   `|`: The `|` means "or." The regex attempts to match either the quoted field pattern *or* the unquoted field pattern.

2. **Escaped Double Quote Handling:**

   ```python
   (match[1] or match[2]).replace('""', '"')
   ```

   This line correctly replaces escaped double quotes (`""`) within a quoted field with a single double quote (`"`).  It's applied to the captured content of the quoted field.

3. **Whitespace Handling and Empty Field Removal:**

   ```python
   [item.strip() for item in result if item]
   ```

   This is a crucial improvement.  It uses a list comprehension to:

   *   **Strip Whitespace:**  `item.strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from each extracted field (both quoted and unquoted). This ensures clean data.
   *  **Removes Empty Items:** `if item` removes any empty fields that may be added to the list due to the regex, this avoids issues in downstream processing.

4. **Clearer Logic:**

   The logic for extracting the field value is simplified by using `(match[1] or match[2])` which resolves into one of the capturing groups, allowing the same steps to be taken regardless of which of the two groups captured the input.

**Why this is better than the original (basic) `line.split(',')`:**

*   **Correctly handles commas within fields:** The original `split(',')` would break fields containing commas into multiple fields, leading to incorrect parsing.  This improved version uses the quotes to identify the correct field boundaries.
*   **Handles escaped double quotes:** The original has no concept of escaped double quotes.
*   **Handles whitespace:** The original doesn't trim whitespace around fields, potentially leading to issues when comparing or using the data.
*   **More robust:** The regular expression approach is generally more robust to variations in CSV formatting.

**How to Use:**

```python
# Example usage
line1 = 'name,age,"city, state",occupation'
line2 = 'name,age,"address with ""double quotes""",occupation'
line3 = ' name , " city , state " ,occupation  ,  "zip"'
line4 = 'field1,"field2 with, comma and ""quotes""",field3'

print(f"Line 1: {parse_csv_line(line1)}")
# Expected: Line 1: ['name', 'age', 'city, state', 'occupation']
print(f"Line 2: {parse_csv_line(line2)}")
# Expected: Line 2: ['name', 'age', 'address with "double quotes"', 'occupation']
print(f"Line 3: {parse_csv_line(line3)}")
# Expected: Line 3: ['name', 'city , state', 'occupation', 'zip']
print(f"Line 4: {parse_csv_line(line4)}")
# Expected: Line 4: ['field1', 'field2 with, comma and "quotes"', 'field3']
```

**Important Considerations for Real-World CSV Parsing:**

*   **`csv` Module:** As mentioned before, the best solution for real-world CSV parsing is to use Python's built-in `csv` module.  It handles many corner cases (e.g., different quote characters, different escape characters, line endings) that are difficult to handle with regular expressions alone.

*   **Error Handling:**  This solution doesn't include explicit error handling.  In production, you should add `try...except` blocks to handle cases like:
    *   Mismatched quotes
    *   Unexpected characters
    *   Incorrect file encodings

*   **Large Files:** If you're processing very large CSV files, consider using techniques like generators or iterators to avoid loading the entire file into memory at once.  The `csv` module works very well in this context.
*   **Character Encoding:**  Always be aware of the character encoding of your CSV file. The default is usually UTF-8, but you might encounter files in other encodings (e.g., Latin-1, Windows-1252).  You can specify the encoding when opening the file: `with open('my_file.csv', 'r', encoding='latin-1') as f:`

In summary, while this solution provides a functional implementation for parsing CSV lines with quoted fields, escaped double quotes, and whitespace handling,  always consider the `csv` module for production environments due to its robustness and comprehensive feature set. Remember to add error handling and be mindful of character encodings.
