```java
public int getLength ( String s ) {
    // What if s is null ?
    if (s == null) {
        return 0; // Or throw an exception, or return a special value like -1
    }
    return s . length () ;
}
```

**Explanation of the Null Dereference Risk:**

The code `s.length()` directly accesses the `length()` method of the `String` object referenced by the `s` variable.  If `s` is `null`, then you are trying to call a method on a non-existent object.  This will cause a `NullPointerException` (NPE) at runtime.  NPEs are a common cause of program crashes and unpredictable behavior.

**How to Mitigate the Risk:**

The most common and appropriate way to handle this risk is to add a null check *before* accessing `s.length()`:

```java
public int getLength ( String s ) {
    if (s == null) {
        // Handle the null case:
        // Option 1: Return a default value (e.g., 0)
        return 0;

        // Option 2: Throw an exception (if null is an invalid input)
        // throw new IllegalArgumentException("String cannot be null");

        // Option 3: Return a special error value (e.g., -1), but this can be confusing
        // return -1;
    }
    return s . length () ;
}
```

**Explanation of the Mitigation Options:**

* **Return a Default Value (e.g., 0):**  This is often the simplest solution if you can reasonably assume that a `null` string should be treated as an empty string (i.e., a string with length 0).  This is a good choice if the calling code is designed to handle an empty string gracefully.

* **Throw an Exception:** If `null` is considered an *invalid* input to the `getLength` method, then throwing an exception is the most appropriate way to signal an error condition.  This forces the calling code to explicitly handle the case where `s` is `null`.  Choose the exception type that best reflects the error; `IllegalArgumentException` is a common choice when a method receives an invalid argument.  Custom exceptions are also viable.

* **Return a Special Error Value (e.g., -1):**  This approach is sometimes used, but it's generally less preferred than the other two.  It relies on the calling code to check for the special error value and handle it appropriately.  It can also be confusing, as -1 may have some other legitimate meaning in some contexts.  It's often better to throw an exception instead of using magic numbers like -1.

**Choosing the Right Approach:**

The best approach depends on the specific requirements of your program and how you want to handle invalid input:

* **If `null` is a valid input that should be treated as an empty string:**  Return 0.
* **If `null` is an *invalid* input that should not be processed:**  Throw an exception.
* **If you absolutely need to avoid exceptions and a special error value makes sense in the context:** Return an error value (but document it clearly).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Documentation:**  Regardless of which approach you choose, *document* your decision clearly in the method's Javadoc (Java documentation comments).  Explain how the method behaves when `s` is `null`.  This will help other developers (and your future self) understand the method's behavior and avoid unexpected issues.

* **Defensive Programming:**  Checking for `null` values is an example of defensive programming, which is a good practice to prevent unexpected errors and make your code more robust.
